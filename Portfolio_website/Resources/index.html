                    <h4>Data Analyst</h4>
                    <p>From the very beginning, I was born and brought up in Mayiladuthurai, my life has been a colorful
                        tapestry woven with the threads of
                        curiosity, ambition, and a touch of romance. Born into a close-knit family of four, I learned
                        the values of unity, perseverance, and the joy of shared moments. My early years were marked by
                        a love for stories—particularly those romantic tales that left me pondering life's intricacies.
                        It's almost ironic that amidst the cinematic dramas of love and longing, I found my true
                        calling: engineering.

                        <br>In the midst of those silver screen stories, I realized that engineering wasn't just about
                        calculations and equations; it was the gateway to crafting a life as exquisite as the most
                        captivating love story. I was captivated by the idea that even the most unconventional paths,
                        like those of the "unfair boys" pursuing engineering, could lead to extraordinary destinations.
                        With this newfound perspective, I embarked on a journey fueled by passion and the desire for
                        knowledge. I was determined to become the first engineering graduate in my immediate family, and
                        I eagerly absorbed every lesson, every concept and every challenge that came my way. As I delved
                        deeper into the world of academia, my fascination for engineering blossomed. I eagerly sought
                        out stories of those who had chosen this path and found their own unique journeys. It was during
                        this time that I stumbled upon a narrative that would shape my destiny—an actor's portrayal of
                        an engineering college student in pursuit of knowledge, love, and a brighter future. Inspired by
                        this cinematic adventure, I began my quest to determine the best engineering course. The answer
                        became clear as day: Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. The promise of this cutting-edge
                        field, with its blend of science, technology, and the potential to shape the future, was
                        irresistible. My journey reached a pivotal moment when I secured a place in the first-ever batch
                        of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at KCG College of Technology. It was a dream come
                        true—a chance to be a part of something groundbreaking and innovative.

                        <br>Today, as I stand before you, I am not just an engineering graduate; I am a Data Enthusiast,
                        driven by the romance of data, the intrigue of machine learning, and the promise of research and
                        discovery. My journey has brought me here, to this unique intersection of passion and
                        profession. Welcome to my portfolio—a testament to my unwavering commitment, my insatiable
                        curiosity, and my unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Join me as we continue this extraordinary
                        story, where every data point is a plot twist, and every algorithm is a hero in its own right.

                                    journey as an intern at Proglint, a dynamic startup that ignited my passion for data
                                    science and technology. This opportunity was a turning point in my academic journey,
                                    as it allowed me to bridge the gap between theory and practical application.

                                    Armed with knowledge about programming languages and data science concepts, I was
                                    eager to understand how these tools translated into real-world solutions. It was
                                    here that I delved into the realm of Python, SQL, Django, and OpenCV, honing my
                                    skills under the mentorship of industry experts.

                                    What made this experience truly exceptional was the unwavering belief and guidance
                                    of my Team Leader, Mr. Mukesh Sai Kumar. He recognized my potential and entrusted me
                                    with responsibilities that pushed me to excel. Mukesh was not just a leader but also
                                    my mentor, guiding me through the intricacies of AI and data science.

                                    During my internship, I had the privilege of working on diverse projects that
                                    encompassed the realms of computer vision and data analysis. I spearheaded the
                                    development of a real-time attendance system using OpenCV, a project that tested my
                                    problem-solving skills and sparked my fascination with computer vision.

                                    In addition, I delved into the world of sentiment analysis using Django, deciphering
                                    opinions and emotions from text data. My journey also included creating a time
                                    series forecasting model for sales, a project that showcased the practical
                                    application of machine learning.

                                    As my internship drew to a close, I not only acquired valuable technical skills but
                                    also gained insights into the culture of the tech industry and to handle pressure. I
                                    learned how to work efficiently, collaborate effectively with teams, and write code
                                    that solves real-world challenges.

                                    This transformative experience at Proglint was a testament to my dedication to data
                                    science and technology. It reaffirmed my commitment to delivering data-driven
                                    solutions and fostering innovation in the ever-evolving world of tech.

                                        <p class="Volunteer-description"> In 2023, I embarked on a fulfilling journey as
                                            a member of Toastmasters International, a global community dedicated to
                                            honing communication and leadership skills. My decision to join this
                                            esteemed organization was driven by a profound desire to not only enhance my
                                            own abilities but also to empower others through effective communication.

                                            Toastmasters became my platform for personal growth and self-discovery. I
                                            recognized that effective communication is the bedrock of success in any
                                            field, and I was eager to refine this skill. However, my journey in
                                            Toastmasters offered much more than I could have imagined.

                                            My Toastmasters journey began with butterflies in my stomach and a racing
                                            heart. Speaking in front of an audience for the first time during a club
                                            meeting was a nerve-wracking experience. As I stood before the members, my
                                            words stumbled, and my voice quivered. It was a defining moment that forced
                                            me to confront my stage fright.

                                            Overcoming that initial fear was not easy, but with the unwavering support
                                            and encouragement of my fellow Toastmasters, I persevered. I embraced each
                                            speaking opportunity as a chance to grow and improve. Through consistent
                                            practice and constructive feedback, I gradually found my voice and gained
                                            confidence.

                                            Through regular participation in Toastmasters meetings and events, I had the
                                            privilege of developing my communication skills, mastering the art of public
                                            speaking, and sharpening my ability to convey ideas with clarity and impact.
                                            These invaluable skills have not only been instrumental in my academic and
                                            professional endeavors but have also boosted my self-confidence.

                                            What truly sets Toastmasters apart is its emphasis on leadership
                                            development. As a member, I actively engaged in leadership roles within the
                                            club, taking on responsibilities that required effective planning,
                                            organization, and collaboration. These experiences allowed me to evolve as a
                                            leader and a team player.

                                            One of the most rewarding aspects of my journey in Toastmasters was the
                                            opportunity to support and mentor fellow members. I found immense
                                            satisfaction in helping others unlock their potential, overcome their
                                            communication challenges, and achieve their goals.

                                            My volunteer experience with Toastmasters International was not just about
                                            improving my communication and leadership skills; it was a journey of
                                            self-improvement, personal growth, and the joy of giving back. It reinforced
                                            the belief that effective communication is not merely a tool for personal
                                            success but a means to empower and uplift those around us.

                                        demand is paramount. In response to this challenge, I embarked on the journey of
                                        developing a cutting-edge "Time Series Forecasting" project. This project serves
                                        as a vital tool for retailers, with a specific focus on online retail
                                        applications like MilkBasket, Dunzo, and Zepto.
                                        <br>
                                        At its core, Time Series Forecasting harnesses the predictive capabilities of
                                        advanced models, including ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and
                                        SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous
                                        Regressors). These models go beyond traditional forecasting methods,
                                        incorporating seasonal and exogenous factors that impact sales patterns.
                                        <br>
                                        The project begins by collecting historical sales data, allowing it to identify
                                        recurring trends, seasonality, and external influences. By delving deep into
                                        this data, the system can make accurate forecasts for the near future. This, in
                                        turn, enables retailers to optimize their inventory management, ensuring that
                                        they have the right products in stock when customers need them the most.

                                        A few examples of online retail giants that have embraced this innovative
                                        forecasting approach. By utilizing the insights generated by this project, these
                                        platforms can proactively adjust their inventory levels, minimize stockouts, and
                                        enhance customer satisfaction.

                                            Cloud-Backed Face Recognition and AI-Driven</span></h3>
                                    <p> I am currently engaged in cutting-edge research aimed at developing an advanced
                                        automated attendance system known as "SmartFace AttendX". This research project
                                        is at the forefront of innovation, combining cloud-backed face recognition,
                                        AI-driven reporting, and an array of sophisticated technologies to revolutionize
                                        attendance management. While I can't divulge specific details at this stage due
                                        to confidentiality, I am excited about the potential impact of this research on
                                        both educational institutions and various organizations.
                                        The ongoing research explores the boundaries of facial recognition, cloud
                                        computing and automation, with a strong focus on precision, scalability and
                                        adaptability. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of technology to create a
                                        robust system that will redefine how attendance is managed an indispensable tool
                                        for efficiency and accountability in the digital age.
